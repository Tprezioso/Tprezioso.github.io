# How to Make a Launch Screen in SwiftUI
In this post we are going to look at how we can implement a launch screen in our SwiftUI project. In the past we would usually have to use a storyboard or XIB file to make our launch screens. In SwiftUI, we can now use the **Info.plist** to make our launch screen.

Let us get started by first navigating to our **Info.plist** file and towards the bottom we should see a **"Launch Screen"** area in our plist.

If we click the little plus button next to where it says **"Dictionary"** we should see a list of options popup.

1. **Background color:** Here we can set the color of the launch screens background
2. **Image name:** Here we can set an image to our launch screen at the images size / resolution
3. **Image respects safe area insets:** This is a bool where we can allow the image to respect or exceed the safe area of the screen
4. **Show navigation bar:** This is a bool where we can display a mock up of a Navigation bar
5. **Show Tab bar:** This is a bool where we can display a mock up of a Tab bar
6. **Show Toolbar:** This is a bool where we can display a mock up of a tool bar

In this example we are only going to add an image to our launch screen. To do this we will click on the **"Image Name"** option. This will add an image name property to our plist with a blank string. We will leave this blank for now but we will soon fill it in with our image name.

Next we will need to add an image to our **Assets.xcassets** file. Once we have dragged and dropped an image into our **Assets.xcassets** file, we will now copy the image name and paste it into the string area of **"Launch Screen**" "**Image Name"** back in our plist.

As you can see in the images above we added an image named **"144"** to our projects assets file. We then set that image in our **Info.plist** to be our launch screen image (_Don't ever name an image with a number_ ðŸ¤¢). Now if we go and run our app we should see a quick glimpse of our launch screen image before the app loads.

That is all you need to make a launch screen in SwiftUI! This is just another example of how SwiftUI makes developers lives that much easier.

Hope this helps you on your next SwiftUI project!
