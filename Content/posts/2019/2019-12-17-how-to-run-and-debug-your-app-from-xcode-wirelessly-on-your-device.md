# How to run and debug your app from Xcode wirelessly on your Device

I recently purchased a new Mac and when transferring everything over from my old Mac to my new Mac I forgot to setup wireless debugging in Xcode. I love not having to have your iPhone or iPad connected to your Mac to run your code and debug. I have been taking advantage of this feature since WWDC 2017 and its become such a big part of how I test and run my code on my devices. When I didn't have this feature turned on in Xcode on my new Mac I thought something was broken or wrong with Xcode. Once you have this enabled you will feel the same way!

Lets see how we go about setting up one of my favorite features in Xcode.

1. Open your Xcode project
2. Connect your iPhone or iPad with your computer (One time only)
3. In the menu bar at the top open Window > Devices and Simulator

You should see your device connected in the Devices tab.

4\. Click on the devices tab if you have not and check the little box next to your device that says "Connect via network"

Your all set!

Pretty easy!

5\. Now you should be able to unplug your device and hit run on your Xcode Project and it should run on your device without a cable!

Congrats! Enjoy all the sweet wireless debugging life! 🎉👨🏻‍💻💻📱
