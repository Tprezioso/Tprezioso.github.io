# How to get text to wrap around in a ScrollView in SwiftUI

As of this posting I was having a problem with an Apple Watch app I was trying to make using SwiftUI. The problem was text was not wrapping around my view that was nested in a ScrollView and VStack. I found that by adding these modifiers to your text will giving you multiple lines for text! Happy Coding!
